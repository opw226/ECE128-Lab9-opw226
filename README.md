The purpose of this lab is for students to learn about and understand the differences between Sequential and Combinational Multipliers. The students will write two modules and simulate Verilog code for a Sequential and a Combinational Multiplier. The students will also need to demonstrate the working multipliers using their board, whether it be the LEDs or the seven-segment display. The students must create a testbench for each type of multiplier that can demonstrate correct usage through a waveform and different test cases.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c7b1390-1598-4369-b4e2-a6f026025797)
